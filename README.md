Assignment 4 Due Thursday, April 11:
    
    1.	You must be able to execute:

•	Assignment operations to 

•	simple variables (Int, Float, Bool) and String variables.

•	arrays as targets with scalars or arrays as sources

•	array elements

•	string elements

•	Complex expressions involving

•	many operations

•	multiple data types

•	simple builtin functions

•	LENGTH(string) //done, needs other checking though

•	SPACES(string)

•	ELEM(array)

•	MAXELEM(array)

•	arrrays

•	array element references with boundary check

•	string element references with boundary check, including support for negative subscripts

•	operators:

•	numeric: + - * / ^ //done

•	string:  # // 90% done

•	comparison: < > <= >= == != (note that the type of comparison is dependent on the left operand) //done

•	logical: not and or // and, or done. not not done

•	If doing infix, identify unary minus //done

•	Bool constants:  T F //done

•	Simple if statements, if-then-else, nested if statements done

•	while statements //done

•	includes nesting of while statements, if statements, and for statements //need to do for statements

•	print function //done

•	Declaration statements //done
